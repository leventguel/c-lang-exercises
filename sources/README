Resources/      Game Resources

In addition, there is a master Makefile for building all of the archive's code in one shot. Run 'make' for instructions.

To properly compile all examples, you'll need the following libraries and packages:

Required software:
	-Recent version of gcc (2.95 or 3.0 should be fine)
	-Associated libraries (standard with any distribution)
	-Linux kernel 2.2 or above, or possibly
	 FreeBSD. If you have any trouble using this code with
	 FreeBSD, please let me know and I'll correct it.
	 Unfortunately I was unable to test the final version
	 of this code with FreeBSD.

Basic audio support (at least one of the following):
	-OSS (some drivers included with kernel,
         some available from http://www.opensound.com)
	-Latest ALSA (http://www.alsa-project.org)
	 (tested with version 0.5.9)

Optional audio support:
	-Latest ESD (http://www.tux.org/~ricdude/EsounD.html)

Required libraries:
	-SDL 1.2.x (http://www.libsdl.org)
	 I recommend installing from source.
	 If you use RPMs, be sure to install the development libraries
	 as well as the runtime libraries. There are two packages.
	-Latest libsndfile (http://www.zipworld.com.au/~erikd/libsndfile)
	-Ogg Vorbis development libraries, all of them (http://www.vorbis.com)
	 You'll need libvorbis, libogg, libvorbisfile, and libao.
	-Tcl 8.3 (or above), including development libraries.
	 Most Linux distributions come with Tcl.
	-OpenAL, latest Linux release (http://www.openal.org)

Please report any errors you find in this archive to http://fenris.lokigames.com.

Enjoy!

PFJ Notes

Due to changes in API and other such things, I've slightly re-arranged things and fixed the code to work with newer versions of OpenAL and libsndfile. I've also altered this file.

Makefiles are now included in the SDL directory

Changes are listed in the directories concerned.
