Quite a few changes here - the majority of them are down to the audio code being wrong. The bug in the tcp/ip code with bind has been fixed, but other than that, the only big change was the Makefile was broken.

The old version looked for tcl8.3 - I can't remember when the last time it was called that! Anyway, that's been sorted :-)

Enjoy!
