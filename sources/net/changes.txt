Not that many changes in here but ones which could have caused problems.

In all of the examples (except tcpclient), a structure is passed as &sa. gcc gave a compiler warning over this. All that was required to remove the error was

(struct sockaddr *)

to be added before the &sa.

Not a big change, but one which could have caused problems.
