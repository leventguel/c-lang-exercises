HOW TO USE THESE MAKEFILES
--------------------------

Normally, to run a makefile, you just enter at the command line

make

This will load a file called "Makefile".

These makefiles all have a name Makefile.4-x (where x is between 1 and 13). To use these, you must enter at the command prompt

make -f Makefile.4.x

This will make the listing for that makefile.
