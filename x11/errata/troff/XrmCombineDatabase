.SH "Description"
\f(CWXrmCombineDatabase\fP merges the contents of one
database into another.  If the same resource specifier is
used for an entry in both databases, the entry in
\f(CIsource_db\fP will replace the entry in
\f(CItarget_db\fP if \f(CIoverride\fP is \f(CWTrue\fP;
otherwise, the entry in from \f(CIsource_db\fP is discarded.
.LP
If \f(CItarget_db\fP points to a \f(CWNULL\fP database,
\f(CIXrmCombineDatabase\fP simply stores \f(CIsource_db\fP
at the location pointed to by \f(CItarget_db\fP.  Otherwise,
\f(CIsource_db\fP is destroyed by the merge, and the
database pointed to by \f(CItarget_db\fP is not destroyed.
.LP
The database entries are merged without changing values or
types, regardless of the locales of the databases.  The
locale of the target database is not modified.
