.SH "Description"
\f(CWXrmCombineFileDatabase\fP merges the contents of a
resource file into a database.  If the same resource
specifier is used for an entry in both the file and the
database, the entry in the file will replace the entry in
the database if \f(CIoverride\fP is \f(CWTrue\fP; otherwise,
the entry in the file is discarded.
.LP
If \f(CItarget_db\fP points to a \f(CWNULL\fP database,
\f(CWXrmCombineFileDatabase\fP creates a new database, reads
the file into it and stores this new database at the
location pointed to by \f(CItarget_db\fP.  Otherwise, the
database pointed to by \f(CItarget_db\fP is not destroyed by
the merge.
.LP
If the file cannot be read a zero status is returned;
otherwise a nonzero status is returned.
.LP
The file is parsed in the current locale.  The database
entries are merged without changing values or types,
regardless of the locale of the database, and the locale of
the target database is not modified.
