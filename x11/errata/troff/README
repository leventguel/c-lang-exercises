The man pages in this directory are copyright (c) 1991, 1992 by O'Reilly
& Associates.  See the file ../README for more information.

The files in this directory are troff source for the man pages missing
from O'Reilly & Associates' X11R5 Supplement.  If you are unable to
print the files in ../postscript, you can format and print these using
nroff or troff and the "-man" macros as appropriate for your system and
your printer.  If you use troff, you must have the troff fonts CW and CI
defined for courier and courier italic fonts.  The XtAllocateGC man page
contains a table and must be run through tbl.  If you are using nroff on
this page, you may need to pipe the output through "col -b".
