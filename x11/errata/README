						February 11, 1992

The files in this directory are errata for first printing (November
1991) of the book:

		Programmer's Supplement for Release 5 
			of the X Window System

published by O'Reilly & Associates.

There are four man pages that were accidentally omitted from this book.
They are:

	XrmCombineDatabase
	XrmCombineFileDatabase
	XtAllocateGC
	XtScreenDatabase

Postscript source for these man pages can be found in the subdirectory
'postscript', and troff source can be found in the subdirectory 'troff'.
If you do not have access to a postscript printer, you can format the
troff versions of the man pages by using nroff or troff with the '-man'
macros.  See the instructions in troff/README.

The file 'errata' contains miscellaneous errata (mostly typos) that have
been found so far.  You may want to incorporate these changes into your
book by hand, or print the list out and keep it with the book.

Please note that the man pages you find here are copyright (c) 1991,
1992 by O'Reilly & Associates.  See the copyright notice in the R5
Supplement for full details of this copyright.  You may distribute these
man pages and errata freely, as long as you include this README file,
but please note that they are provided for convenience of the owners of
the X11R5 Supplement, and are not intended for general use.

I hope that you've found my book useful, and I hope that the missing man
pages have not been too much of an inconvenience to you.

	Sincerely,
