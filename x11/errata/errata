pg 24, 3rd paragraph:
	"CIExyY, CIExyY,"
should be
	"CIExyY,"

pg 113: 
The third and seventh fprintf() statements have had their formatting
strings truncated where there were supposed to be embedded quote
characters.  The third fprintf() should have the string:
	"%s: X does not support locale \"%s\"\n"
The seventh should have the string:
	"%s: The string \"%s\" will be used in place of\n"

pg 128, last sentence of section 6.5.3:
	"associate a display"
should be
	"associate a database"

pg 134, last sentence of 1st paragraph of section 7.1.1, and last line
of the page:
	_STDC_
should be 
	__STDC__

pg 141, 4th paragraph:
	XtnstartCallback and Xtncallback
should be 
	XtNstartCallback and XtNcallback

pg 164 and 166:
the #define directives on these pages need a space or tab inserted
between the name of the symbol and its value.  

pg 279, 4th line:
	"the name of the host on which"
should be
	"the name of the host on which xrdb is running."

pg 285:
The "Structures" section should begin with the phrase:
	"The legal values for the mode argument are the following:"

pg 307:
In the first and second paragraphs of the "Description" section,
	"XmbLookupString" 
should be 
	"XwcLookupString".
In the third paragraph,
	"required size in characters"
should be
	"required size in wide characters"

pg 308:
In the first paragraph,
	"string length is returned"
should be
	"string length in wide characters is returned"
The entire 4th paragraph should be modified to read:
    When XwcLookupString returns a string, the return value of the function
    is the length, in wide characters, of that string.  The returned string
    is a wide-character string in the encoding of the locale of the input
    context. 

pg 314:
In the "Structures" section,
	"The XICCEncodingStyle structure contains:"
should be:
	"The XICCEncodingStyle type has the following values:"

pg 336:
under the description of xterm, 
	"titleInhibit"
should be
	"titeInhibit"
(The current spelling seems to make more sense, but this resource
inhibits the "TI/TE" escape sequences, not the title.)
