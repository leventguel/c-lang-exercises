These directories contain the source to "The X Window System:
Programming and Applications with Xt, Second Motif Edition", by
Douglas Young, Prentice Hall, 1994, All programs are written in ANSI C
and designed for Motif 1.2. The makefiles are minimal and may need to
be modified to work in various environments.

Appdefaults files needed to mkae various programs work correctly can
be found in the AppDefaults directory.

Bitmaps for some examples can be ound in the Bitmaps directory.

Makefiles have not been tested in all environments, and are
deliberately kept simple to allow you to modify them as needed to
build on your machine. Basically, almost any single-file example can
be built with:

cc -o prog prog.c -lXm -lXt -lX11

Depending on your system, you may need other libraries, or other
flags.
