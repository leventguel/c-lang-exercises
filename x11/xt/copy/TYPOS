This file lists known typos and errors that were caught too late to
make the first printing of the book. Later printings should already
include these fixes. 

ch3, page 64, line 37 of the editor example should be:
      XmNorientation, XmHORIZONTAL,
to achieve the layout shown in figure 3.4

ch5, page 137. Figure 5.6 shows two columns of buttons, while the
example, as written, produces 1. Set numColumns to 2 to get the
layout of figure 5.6

ch5, Pg 160, line 56 of the mainwindow example should be:
XtManageChild(menu);
Without this, the menu bar does not appear.

ch5, page 163. The example and figure 5.20 are confusing. As written,
the program looks like figure 5.21 on page 166. To get figure 5.20,
you would need to change the dimensions of the scale on line 43.

Ch 5, pg 179. Figure 5.30 goes with the following section, not the one
it is in. Mentally move 5.30 and the preceding sentence to pg 182. :-)

Ch 6, Pg 208. The first line of the submenu description has a "."
when it should have a "," (comma) separating entries in the menu
structure.

Ch6, pg 221. helpdemo, line 32 should pass mainWindow as default
clientData for the ContextHelpCallback.

Ch9, Page 298. The last paragraph is misleading. Not all visual types have
a default black or white pixel.

Ch9, page 299, in the footnote, "16 * 24" is supposed to be 16*2^4 (4
should be superscripted.

ch 13, page 439, comment on line 363 has two mispellings, "expect"
and "permantently"

ch13, pg 442, first paragraph: "...,or erase the previous drawn figure"
should read "...,to erase the previously drawn figure".

ch14, pg 480. The formal paramter in XmClipboardCopy() should be
data_id to match the text description.

ch14, pg 488, 489
"XmNdeleteResponce" should be XmNdeleteResponse

ch14, pg 491. Bannner of setupicon source file says "setupicon.h" It
should be "setupicon.c".

ch15, pg 537, Dial.h: "fiel" should be "file"


ch17, pg. 597, the ContstraintSetValues() method should begin with the
lines:

  if (!XtIsRectObj (new_w))
	return (False);    

ch17, pg. 603, the geometry manager should be changed to allow motion
requests, as follows:

   /*
     * To allow the Tree widget to change geometries on the fly, becuase
     * a superNode resource has changed, the Tree widget must allow x,y
     * requests.
     */
    
    if ( request->request_mode & CWX )
        w->core.x = request->x;
    if ( request->request_mode & CWY )
        w->core.y = request->y;
