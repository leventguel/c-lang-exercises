Some programs in this directory use the Xpm library. This is a freely
available library, but is not part of the standard X11 distribution.
You can get it from ftp.x.org under the ~ftp/contrib directory.

These programs expect that you have xpm.h installed under an X11
directory on your include search path, typically /usr/include, and
have libxpm.a somewhere on your library search path, typically
/usr/lib.
