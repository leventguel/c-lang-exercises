The following are various minor changes and problems that have been found
in the accompanying code or the first printing of the book. Code changes
have already been incorporated in the code and will be fixed in later
printings of the text.

Feb 2,1990

** Makefile

On some systems the library may need to be built with the "clq" or other
options to ar rather than the "ruv" options specified in the makefile

** Appendix B

Several widget resource listings specify NULL as the default for resources
such as XmNokLabelString, XmNhelpLabelString, etc. These get defaulted at
run time to "OK", "Help", etc.

** Pg 199.

#include <Xw/Xw.h> is unnecessary and should be removed or changed to Xm/Xm.h


** pg 240

strdup() isn't available on all systems. To be safe, replace

      else
        buf = strdup(text);

with

    else {
      buf = (char *) XtMalloc(strlen(text) +1);
      strcpy(buf, text);
    }


** Pg 318.

The event handler must be registered using ButtonPressMask instead of
ButtonPress.

** pg. 322.

The request_selection function should be registered as a callback, not an
event handler. The correct line is:

 XtAddCallback(request, XmNactivateCallback,
               request_selection, selection);

Also, on the next line, the event handler must be registered using
ButtonPressMask instead of ButtonPress.


** Chapter 12. 

The Dial example has some confused mis-use of GC's. The following changes
should be made:

** Pg 353-354

Replace all XCreateGC() calls in Initialize() with XtGetGC()

** Pg. 355 

Accordingly, change all calls to XFreeGC() in Destroy() to XtReleaseGC():

static void Destroy (w)
     XsDialWidget w;
{
  XtReleaseGC (w, w->dial.indicator_GC);
  XtReleaseGC (w, w->dial.dial_GC);
  XtReleaseGC (w, w->dial.inverse_GC);
  XtRemoveAllCallbacks (w, XtNselectCallback,
                         w->dial.select);
}


** Pg 357.

Add the following text before the last sentence, first paragraph

"However, in this example, the graphics contexts have been created using
XtGetGC(), which creates GCs that may be shared by others.  Therefore we
must not alter the GC in any way, or at least we must undo any changes
immediately. For this example we will take the easy way out and simply not
use the information in the region argument, redrawing the entire face of
the dial instead."

** Finally,

Eliminate the calls to XSetRegion() in the Redisplay() method.

** pg 376

The heading of section 13.2.2 should say "Public" not "Private"

** pg 382: 

The first field of the XtWidgetGeometry structure is request_mode, not
mask. The structure also has a border_width member.

** Pg. 382.

Second to the last sentence, last full paragraph should read:

"If the changes are unacceptable, or if the child's current geometry is
identical to the child's preferred geometry, the method should return
XtGeometryNo."

** Pg 383.

The comparison on the last two lines of code is incorrect in the book. It
should be

if(preferred->width <= request->width &&  
            preferred->height <= request->height){

similarly, in the same routine, the logic should be

if(request->request_mode & CWWidth){
      if(preferred->width <= request->width){
         	preferred->width = request->width;
         return (XtGeometryYes);

and 

if(request->request_mode & CWHeight){
      if(preferred->height <= request->height){
         	preferred->height = request->height;
         	return (XtGeometryYes);
