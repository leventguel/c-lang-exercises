Do a
  make install
That's it.

If the machine has an AMD64 CPU that has the popcnt instruction,
you can uncomment the following line in makefile:
#FXT_CXXFLAGS += -DHAVE_AMD64_POPCNT


By default, things are installed under
/usr/local/lib/  (library)
/usr/local/include/fxt/  (header files)


The install directory can be changed as follows,
  make install PREFIX=/some/dir/
will install things under
/some/dir/lib/  (library)
/some/dir/include/fxt/  (header files)

Note that the directories
/some/dir/
/some/dir/include/
have to exists before the installation.

You need the permissions to write in the directories
/some/dir/
/some/dir/include/
In doubt, do the installation as root.
